//! Async time operators.
//!
//! ## About
//!
//! This crate provides ergonomic, async time-based operations. It serves as an
//! experimental playground to experiment with how we could potentially add
//! time-based operations to `async-std`, and subsequently the stdlib.
//!
//! The goal is to make working with time and other events feel natural. A major
//! source of inspiration for this has been RxJS, which uses events (including
//! time) to trigger operations. This crate takes that principle, inverts the
//! model to make it evaluate lazily, and wraps it in an ergnomic Rust
//! interface.
//!
//! # Futures
//!
//! - [`task::sleep`] Sleeps for the specified amount of time.
//! - [`task::sleep_until`] Sleeps until the specified deadline.
//! - [`Future::delay`](`future::FutureExt::delay`) Delay execution for a specified time.
//! - [`Future::timeout`](`future::FutureExt::timeout`) Cancel the future if the execution takes longer than the specified time.
//!
//! # Streams
//!
//! - [`stream::interval`](`stream::interval`) Creates a new stream that yields at a set interval.
//! - `Stream::audit`
//! - [`Stream::buffer`](`stream::StreamExt::buffer`) Returns a stream which buffers items and flushes them at each interval.
//! - [`Stream::debounce`](`stream::StreamExt::debounce`) Returns a stream that debounces for the given duration.
//! - [`Stream::delay`](`stream::StreamExt::delay`) Delay execution for a specified time.
//! - `Stream::sample`
//! - [`Stream::throttle`](`stream::StreamExt::throttle`) Filter out all items after the first for a specified time.
//! - [`Stream::timeout`](`stream::StreamExt::timeout`) Cancel the stream if the execution takes longer than the specified time.
